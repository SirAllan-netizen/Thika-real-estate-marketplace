# 🏡 Thika Real Estate Marketplace

A web-based rental marketplace tailored for Thika Town, Kenya. This platform bridges the gap between landlords and tenants by offering real-time listings, secure communication, demographic-focused features, and an intuitive user experience.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the Bachelor of Business Information Technology program at Mount Kenya University. It addresses the inefficiencies in Thika’s rental market, which traditionally relies on physical scouting, agents, or outdated listings.

By leveraging Agile development, Laravel, MySQL, and modern UI/UX practices, this platform enables:

- Transparent tenant-landlord interactions  
- Location-based rental searches  
- Secure property listing management  
- Review and rating systems for trust-building
